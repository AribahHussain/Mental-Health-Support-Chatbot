This project uses the EmpatheticDialogues dataset 🧠, a large-scale collection of open-domain conversations curated by Facebook AI Research for training emotionally intelligent dialogue systems. The dataset includes over 25,000 short conversations between two individuals: one describing a personal situation and the other responding empathetically 💬🤝. Each dialogue is annotated with one of 32 emotion labels such as lonely, afraid, grateful, or devastated, allowing models to learn nuanced emotional responses. It is widely used in natural language understanding tasks and is available on the Hugging Face Hub 🤗 under an open MIT license. By fine-tuning conversational models like DialoGPT or Mistral-7B-Instruct on this dataset, the chatbot gains the ability to recognize emotional context and provide comforting, non-clinical replies ❤️. This makes it especially useful for applications focused on mental wellness, emotional support, and safe user interaction. Importantly, the dataset avoids sensitive or medical-specific content, ensuring it’s ethical and suitable for educational and support-based use cases 🔐📚.
