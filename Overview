# 💬 Mental Health Support Chatbot

This project creates a safe and empathetic chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide non-clinical emotional support. It is built to simulate friendly dialogue, offering users a comforting space to express their feelings.

## ✅ Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a chatbot that offers general mental health support without giving clinical advice. It responds in a supportive tone and avoids any conversation around crisis or diagnoses.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Main programming language  
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – For implementing conversational AI  
- **DialoGPT-medium (Microsoft)** – Pre-trained model for dialogue generation  
- **NLTK & re** – Used for keyword detection and filtering sensitive content

## 🧠 Methodology

- **Library Setup**: Installed required NLP and utility libraries  
- **Model Loading**: Loaded `DialoGPT-medium` from Hugging Face  
- **Safety Filtering**: Blocked unsafe input with predefined keyword lists  
- **Conversation Loop**: Chat continues until user types `"quit"`  
- **Response Style**: Empathetic and general tone for emotional support

## 🔐 Safety Measures

- No diagnostic, emergency, or treatment responses are given  
- Queries with risky terms (e.g., "suicide", "self-harm") are blocked  
- Designed for non-clinical use only, promoting a safe user experience

## 📈 Results

- Handles emotional conversations respectfully  
- Declines to answer unsafe or crisis-related input  
- Shows potential for use in wellness apps or research settings

## 📌 Conclusion

This chatbot proves how AI can be responsibly applied in mental health contexts. While it doesn't replace professional support, it can serve as a companion tool in mental wellness platforms or educational prototypes.
